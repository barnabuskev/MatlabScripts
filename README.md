These are Matlab scripts mainly written by me, but also other authors.



INSTRUCTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Github will be the central place for storing matlab scripts and changes will be referred back to github

To copy onto computer for first time for editing:

	git clone https://github.com/barnabuskev/MatlabScripts.git

Make changes on local directory and then 'add' the file ('stage changes'):

	git add <filename>

where filename is the name of the file that has been changed. You can then commit it/them to the present branch:

	git commit

You can then push changes to github:

	git push

Enter username and password.

The above description does not use any branching and assumes the master branch is used. To use branching, create a branch in the local repository:

	git checkout nameofbranch
