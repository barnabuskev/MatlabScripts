liTimeStamp.binary files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read as signed 64 bit integers (sign doesn't matter they are all positive values)



For each frame 5 rows are written to file:


1) the frame count since the beginning of data recording

2) the frame counter since KinectExplorer-D2D started

3) zero (always)

4) the time in miliseconds since ???

5) the same time value as in 4) (always)




Joint position binary files:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The program can track up to six skeletons at once. For the first four, all joints are tracked. 
For the last two, only the center of mass is tracked. The same space is allocated for all six skeletons, whether they
are tracked or not and whether or not the COM or the joints are recorded.

In the raw data, each row has only one value. Each frame (time point) has 4 values per joint (3 coordinates and 1 for tracking state), 20 joints, and 6 skeletons i.e. 4*20*6 = 480 rows and not 120 as stated in the link above

where there is data (i.e. data> 0), there are 3 floating point numbers followed by a 1 or a 2.

The floating points represent x,y & z values. 
Tracking states: 0=joint is not tracked; 1=joint is inferred; 2=joint is tracked


Where there is data the run of data lasts for 80, ie 20 sets of 4 ie the joint positions of 20 joints at that point



Joint order:
HIP_CENTER, SPINE, SHOULDER_CENTER, HEAD, SHOULDER_LEFT, ELBOW_LEFT, WRIST_LEFT, HAND_LEFT, SHOULDER_RIGHT, ELBOW_RIGHT, WRIST_RIGHT, HAND_RIGHT, HIP_LEFT, KNEE_LEFT, ANKLE_LEFT, FOOT_LEFT, HIP_RIGHT, KNEE_RIGHT, ANKLE_RIGHT, FOOT_RIGHT
